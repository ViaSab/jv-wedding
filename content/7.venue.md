# Ferme Marie-Hélène

## Location

**La Ferme Marie Hélène - 11 rue de l'église, 67370 Neugartheim-Ittlenheim, France**

Just 20 minutes west of Strasbourg, lies a region or soft rolling hills, dotted with small villages, bell towers, and farm fields with the backdrop of the Vosge mountains.

Nestled in Neugartheim-Ittlenheim, lies the 200 year old dwelling.

Its traditional Alsacian charm mixed with its modern homey touches is why we loved this venue. The half-timber house and gardens are to be adored. Relax in its tranquility with a glass of local Alsace wine.
