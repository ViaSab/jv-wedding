## Location

Just 20 minutes west of Strasbourg, lies a region or soft rolling hills, dotted with small villages, bell towers, and farm fields with the backdrop of the Vosge mountains.

Nestled in Neugartheim-Ittlenheim, lies the 200 year old dwelling La Ferme Marie Hélène. It's traditional Alsacian charm mixed with it's modern homey touches is why we loved this venue. The half-timber house and gardens are to be adored. Relax in it's tranquility with a glass of local Alsace wine.
